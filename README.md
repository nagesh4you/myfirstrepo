# Hello World!

This is my first repository on github. Here, I'm using markdown for examples.

**Markdown** is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling all forms of writing on the GitHub platform.

Start lines with a `#` to create headings. Multiple `##` in a row denote smaller heading sizes.

### This is a third-tier heading

You can use one `#` all the way up to `######` six for different heading sizes.

It's very easy to make some words **bold** and other words *italic* with Markdown. You can even [link to Google!](http://google.com)
This code example is created with inspiration from the source - [Mastering Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown)

If you'd like to quote someone, use the > character before the line:
> "Alone we can do so little, together we can do so much."
> â€“ Helen Keller

GitHub supports emoji! :sparkles: :smiley: :boom:
