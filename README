# Hello World!

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling all forms of writing on the GitHub platform.

Start lines with a `#` to create headings. Multiple `##` in a row denote smaller heading sizes.

### This is a third-tier heading

You can use one `#` all the way up to `######` six for different heading sizes.

It's very easy to make some words **bold** and other words *italic* with Markdown. You can even [link to Google!](http://google.com)
This code example is created with inspiration from the source - [Mastering Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown)

If you'd like to quote someone, use the > character before the line:
> "Alone we can do so little, together we can do so much."
> – Helen Keller

> Here will I kneel, for thou redeemed hast
> My life from too thin breathing: gone and past
> Are cloudy phantasms. Caverns lone, farewel!
> And air of visions, and the monstrous swell
> Of visionary seas! No, never more
> Shall airy voices cheat me to the shore
> Of tangled wonder, breathless and aghast.

it’s _John Keats_ from the poem *Endymion*
